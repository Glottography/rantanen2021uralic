# Data selection

This dataset only contains a subset of the language distributions from the source dataset - namely
the features from the "traditional" shapefiles in the
`Geospatial datasets/Language distributions/Expert distributions/Languages/`
directory.


# Focal year

The `year` column in `ContributionTable` has a value of "traditional" for all features of this dataset.
The source dataset describes this "traditional" epoch as follows:

> at the beginning of the 20th century – indicating approximately the widest known distribution of the Uralic languages

Some exceptions are described:

> For Mator and Kamas, which became extinct in the 19th and 20th centuries, respectively (Dolgix 1960), the “traditional distribution” refers to the beginning of the 19th century.
